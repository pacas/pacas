I am a regular student. I study python in my spare time and add interesting results here. 
For the most part, there will be jun-level code here, but I hope to improve it over time.
My graduate work as a Bachelor - [Mod Manager for the game Stellaris](https://github.com/pacas/Stellaris_PMMP). Take a look and help me improve my code.
Peace and tranquility to you.
